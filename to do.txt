Hi,

For the future development, I'm open to any sugestion, idea, code improvment,
...

What I would like to have is a 'virtualized HPIB' bus mapped on bsd sockets (for
 example) with a hub doing the 3 wires handshake and dealing with inout, in and
 out parts to be able to have virtual hpib instrument as external programs (disk,
  printer emulation, plotter, ...)

But first some API should be written, coded, ...
I think the hpib internal controller should be re-written in this case (perhaps
using the rather complete TMS9914A data manual from TI) by coding all the state
machines described in this doc

Other nice project could be coding the hp mmu for U models to be able to run old
 HPUX when someone put a disk image on the net. The only doc of this mmu are the
 schematics from Tony Duell

Also mapping the 98626 (serial interface) to a real serial interface of the host
machine ...

So many things are possible

Olivier
