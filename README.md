# hp98x6
A fork of Olivier De Smet's HP98x6 emulator.

This emulator is in really rough shape. Some menu interfaces don't work right, a broken Windows XP theme, and a whole bunch of other issues. What's worse,
is that the emulator isn't available for download any more. I used the Wayback Machine to download the source code.

## TODO list
- Update the UI for modern versions of Windows
- Fix broken menu interface elements
- Port to Linux/macOS (maybe)
- An updated interface
- Some other things

Feel free to make a pull request in case you found a bug and fixed it, or that you want to add new feature to the emulator.
